                <p>I while back I thought, "what if I used the webAudio API to sample the frequency spectrum of asound
                    wave at regular intervals, and then stacked the results back to back?" I bet I could get a pretty
                    cool, 3d-terrain-like effect! And why not use the device microphone as the sound source while I'm at
                    it? The result was pretty-analyser. As a side benefit, it gave me an excuse to finally dive in and
                    get my hands dirty with the HTML canvas element. Good stuff.

                <p>Melo-type is a text-based, melodic step sequencer built on the Web Audio API. Within the app, each
                    key is assigned a musical note value based on its keyboard position. You can audition a melody by
                    typing in the main text area, then hit the 'start' button to hear it played back in a loop. You can
                    also hit the 'demo' button to load an example from a bank of sample melodies.</p>

                <p>"Bertz by Kurt" is... an art project? Basically, I took one of my favorite loops, dropped it into an
                    audioBuffer and built a visually interesting UI around it where I could adjust the audio playback
                    rate. I like to listen to it on super-low speed while I work.</p>

                <p>Qwerbord is a browser based polyphonic synthesizer with an intuitive keyboard interface (hopefully).
                    I wanted a musical typing tool that didn't try to mimic the white and black keys of a piano, so I
                    designed the key layout such that playing a given shape anywhere on the keyboard will always produce
                    the same musical interval. For example, if you press one key, and then press its neighbor one row up
                    and to the right, you will always produce a major third.</p>
